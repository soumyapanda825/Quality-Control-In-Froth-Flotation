# Iron Purity Prediction

*Project Overview:*
In this project, we utilized a Froth Flotation dataset to delve into the intricacies of iron ore quality prediction. Our primary objective was to understand and predict impurity levels, particularly silica content, post the froth flotation process used in iron ore purification.

*EDA:*
We embarked on a comprehensive EDA journey, uncovering patterns, distributions, and correlations within the dataset. This phase provided crucial insights into the characteristics of the data.

*Machine Learning Models:*
Leveraging the power of sklearn, we implemented machine learning models for prediction. Notably, Linear Regression and Random Forest models were employed to forecast impurity levels. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.


*Model Performance:* 
Our models exhibited commendable performance, with an R2 score of 0.5 for Linear Regression and an impressive 0.82 for Random Forest on the test data. These scores indicate the models' capability to capture and predict the variation in impurity levels.

Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning algorithm renowned for its versatility and robustness. It constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of individual trees. It excels in handling complex datasets, mitigating overfitting, and providing high predictive accuracy.
